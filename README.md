# Nutional_Server_Facts
This is based off a webpage i found around 2003-ish that had pseudo nutritional facts of the server specs. Only problem is I had just the html output saved. So I finally got around to doing the backend code to give realtime outputs of hdd space,memory,network stats,users,& uptime. Tested on a Rapsberry Pi running Raspian. Result may vary on your system due to system calls, adjust accordingly.
